## Dry Ice Safety
This week we will be using dry ice in lab. Please carefully read through the following safety material before coming to lab.

Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide and sublimates (goes directly from solid to gas without becoming an liquid) at -78.5°C (194.65 K or −109.3 °F).

## Hazards

+ Eyes are extremely susceptible to cryogen damage and safety glasses must be worn while dry ice is being used. If you have safety goggles please bring them to lab, if not safety glasses will be provided.

+ Handling of dry ice without proper insulation can lead to tissue damage (frostbite) that is similar to thermal burns. When filling your cup of dry ice at the front of lab always use the gloves provided. At your station use the tongs to handle the dry ice. Do not touch dry ice with your bare skin.

+ When dry ice boils to the gas phase (at -78.5°C ) it is released into the air. In a confined space, oxygen displacement may occur, resulting in asphyxiation. Carbon dioxide is a normal part of the air we breathe, but too much of it is toxic. Always work in a well ventilated area when using dry ice.

+ Store the dry ice in a insulated cooler. Just a simple styrofoam cooler will be plenty. Never store dry ice in a container that is tightly sealed due to the rapidly expanding gas and pressure buildup.

## Waste Disposal
Do not dispose of excess dry ice or cryogenic liquids in sinks. Thermal shock may damage pipe system.  Allow small amounts of excess materials to evaporate naturally. In other words, leave your dry ice in the Styrofoam cup at your station at the end of lab.

## First Aid
Dry ice is very cold, but not very dangerous if used responsibly. However, in the unlikely event that there is an injury please take the following actions:

–For frostbite, warm area with warm, not hot water. Do not rub affected area.

–For splashes to the eyes use eyewash for 15 minutes to warm affected area. Safety showers may be used in the event of large body area contact. Remove affected clothing before using safety shower. Keep victim at normal body temperature until responders arrive.

For emergency medical response dial extension 72000 from a campus phone (909-607-2000 from a cell phone). Provide responder/physician with a copy of the [SDS](https://www.airgas.com/msds/001091.pdf).
