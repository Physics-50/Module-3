## Goals for This Week

This week you should complete the solar panel investigation you planned and started during Week 2.  This might include drafting all or part of your report during lab this week, if you are ready to do so.  Even if you do not draft your report this week, make sure you leave lab with any information and/or images you will need to include in the report.

You will also spend some time this week, or before lab, making plans for the technical report.

## Tech Report Preparation

The tech report will take up the remaining lab weeks after this one.  For the tech report you will come up with a question and investigate it using equipment based one of the three modules you have already done (or begun) in this course.  You will have two weeks to conduct the investigation, and the final week of class will be devoted to oral reports by each group.  You will work with a lab partner, but the choice of partners is up to you for this final module.  As your mini-question this week, you must submit a tech report idea and a list of equipment you need for your experiment.  Each partner must submit the mini-question, though it is OK to agree on detailed answers in advance.  To give you a chance to consult with your partner and/or instructor during lab, his week's mini-question can be turned in any time before _or during_ the Week 3 lab meeting.
