## Lab Instructions for Week 3

### Collection of High-Quality Data

Make sure you are using the same levitator as last week (you should have made note of the levitator number).

Over the past two weeks you should have carefully investigated significant sources of systematic error for this experiment. Your goal this week is to make a careful measurement of the speed of sound. 

You will do this by analyzing at least 5 images. For each image make sure you have minimized all significant sources of systematic error. Between images make sure you reset the experiment to further randomize systematic errors. You are encouraged to check in with your instructor to confirm you are resetting all parameters of significance. This should include repositioning the ruler as well as the position of the levitator relative to the camera in between each measurement, as well as levitating a fresh set of beads for each photo.

You should determine the effective wavelength separately from each image.  You must settle on a good method for doing this. Perhaps you want to plot position vs. node number and make use of the slope, or perhaps you will use the separation between a pair of beads some known number of nodes apart. Whatever method you use, you will need to determine the effective wavelength and its uncertainty from each image. Remember that you can only use SEM to estimate random uncertainty in $$\lambda_{eff}$$ if you have decided to analyze each image in several different ways or to repeat the same or very similar analysis of the image several times from scratch.  However you arrive at it, you should have a $$\lambda_{eff}$$ value and a justifiable, non-zero $$\delta \lambda_{eff}$$ value for each image individually.

### Analysis of Data from Two Images

Once you have two good images with at least 6 beads (make sure to reposition the ruler, beads, camera or levitator and anything else you think might be important between images) you should perform an analysis of the first two photos --- doing a preliminary analysis along the way can save you time by ensuring there aren't any major flaws in your data collection before collecting a full set of data. You may want to have lab partners working separately to extract data from each of the two photos in parallel, but make sure you agree on the process you will use.

Are the results from your first two images consistent with each other?  If not, are there good reasons for the discrepancy?  Do you still have reason to believe that combining results from several images analyzed like this should give a good value for the speed of sound?

### Collection of Complete Data Set

Continue to accumulate a total of at least five good images with at least 6 beads in each image, following the process you used for the first two images if your preliminary analysis gave you confidence in it.

You should make use of the "week 3: data" tab on your Google sheets document to collect your data this week. As in the rest of this module, you will be responsible for setting up your own spreadsheet this module but should make sure it is organized so that instructors and graders can easily follow your work.


### Analysis of Data

Once you've measured the effective wavelength with uncertainty from each of your 5 images, you should copy the data to the sheet: "week 3: plotting" - look back to the spreadsheets from previous modules for how to link cells between different sheets within the same spreadsheet. From there you should plot the effective wavelength vs. image number.  You will fit a horizontal line to this data to determine your final value of $$\lambda_{eff}$$.

### Image of Apparatus

As for the previous modules, you will need an uncluttered image or images of your experimental setup (with a scale bar) for your deliverable. In this case it is likely that you will find the images you've already taken will meet some of your needs. But just in case, before leaving lab take a moment to think if you need to take any additional photos to showcase your experimental procedure in the deliverable.


## What you need to leave lab with this week

+ 5 images of levitated beads for which you both reset the ruler and the beads, plus anything else it is important to reset between trials. Each image needs to include at least 6 beads; more would be preferable.

+ From each image you will need to determine $$\lambda_{eff}$$ with uncertainty. You will then fit a horizontal line to your five values to determine your final value of $$\lambda_{eff}$$.

+ Don't leave until you have used the results of this plot, along with other information given in the lab manual, to calculate a final value of the speed of sound, and its uncertainty.  **You need to make use of the correction introduced last week to account for the non-planar nature of the sound waves.**

# Checkpoint 3

For checkpoint 3 our usual rules apply:
**Reminder:** Please prepare your assignment in a separate document, enter all entries in a single sitting without using the "save" button, and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting).

+ A link to your organized spreadsheet which includes the data from your analysis of 5 different images.

+ The 5 photos used for your data analysis

+ A description of how you measured the effective wavelength and its uncertainty from an individual image.

+ The measured effective wavelength and uncertainty for one of your 5 images (it doesn't matter which one).

+ A plot of effective wavelength vs. image number that includes a horizontal line of best fit. Each of your data points should include an estimated uncertainty. 

+ You will be asked to share your conclusions from your results. As part of your conclusion you should include your final value for the speed of sound with uncertainty from your data. Your answer to this question should mention your reduced $$\chi^2$$ value and any inferences you might make from it, as well as the agreement or disagreement of your results with expectations.
