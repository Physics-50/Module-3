## Lab Instructions for Week 3

### Collection of Preliminary Data

Make sure you are using the same levitator as last week (you should have made note of the levitator number).

Over the past two weeks you should have carefullh investigated significant sources of systematic error for this experiment. Your goal this week is to make a careful measurement of the speed of sound. 

You will do this by analyzing at least 5 images. For each image make sure you have minimized all significant sources o systematic error. Between images make sure you reset the experiment to further randomize systematic errors. You are encouraged to check in with your instructor to confirm you are resetting all parameters of significance. This should include repositioning the ruler as well as the position of the levitator relative to the camera in between each measurement, as well as levitating a fresh set of beads for each photo.

You should determine the speed of sound separately for each image. You may determine the method you use to determine the speed of sound from each image. This might include plotting position v.s. node number and making use of the slope to determine the wavelength, or you might use the separation between the outer beads and your knowledge of the number of wavelengths. In either case you will need to estimate the uncertainty in your estimate from each image. This will not include random uncertainty (since it is from a single image) but might include your ability to determine the center of the beads. 

Once you have two good images with at least 6 beads (make sure to reposition the ruler, beads, camera or levitator and anything else you think might be important between images) you should perform an analysis of the first two photos --- doing a preliminary analysis along the way can save you time by ensuring there aren't any major flaws in your data collection before collecting a full set of data. You may want to have one lab partner extract data from each of the two photos in parallel, but make sure you agree on the origin you will use.

You should make use of the "week 3: data" tab on your Google sheets document to collect your data this week. As in the rest of this module, you will be responsible for setting up your own Spreadsheet this module but should make sure it is organized in a way that the graders can easily follow your work.

**For all of the data analysis you do this week you need to make use of the correction introduced last week to account for the non-planar nature of the sound waves.

### Analysis of Data

Once you've estimated the speed of sound with uncertainty from each of your 5 images, you should copy the data to the sheet: "week 3: plotting" - look back to the spreadsheets from previous modules for how to link cells between different sheets within the same spreadsheet. From there you should plot your measured speed of sound v.s. image number. Note that since your uncertainty on the individual data points does not include random uncertainty you should expect a reduced $$\chi^2>1$$ for this plot. 



### Collection of Complete Data Set

As for the previous modules, you will need an uncluttered image or images of your experimental setup (with a scale bar) for your deliverable. In this case it is likely that you will find the images you've already taken will meet your needs. But just in case, before leaving lab take a moment to think if you need to take any additional photos to showcase your experimental procedure in the deliverable.

Make sure to note which levitator you are using (it should be the same one that you used last week).


## What you need to leave lab with this week

+ 5 images of levitated beads for which you both reset the ruler and the beads. Each image needs to include at least 6 beads, more would be preferable.

+ From each image you will need to determine the speed of sound with uncertainty. You will then fit a horiztonal line to your five values to determine your best estimate of the speed of sound.

# Checkpoint 3

For checkpoint 3 our usual rules apply:
**Reminder:** Please prepare your assignment in a separate document, enter all entries in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting).

+ A link to your organized spreadsheet which includes the data from your analysis of 5 different images.

+ The 5 photos used for your data analysis

+ A description of how you estimated the uncertainty in the measured wavelength from an individual image.

+ You will be asked to report the measured effective wavelength, calculated wavelength after correcting for the non-planar sound waves, and measured speed of sound along with their respective uncertainties for one of your 5 images (it doesn't matter which one). You will also be asked to describe how you determined the uncertainty in wavelength for the individual images.

+ A plot of speed of sound v.s. image number that includes a horizontal line of best fit. Each of your data points should include an estimated uncertainty. 

+ You will be asked to share your conclusions from your results. As part of your conclusion you should include your best estimate of the speed of sound with uncertainty from your data. Your answer to this question should mention your reduced $$\chi^2$$ value and any inferences you might make from it, as well as the agreement or disagreement of your results with expectations.
