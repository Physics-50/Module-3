This week we will continue our investigation of the wavelength the light from the laser pointer you were shipped. The kit you received includes diffraction gratings with two different spacings.

#### Miniquestion: How do the diffraction patterns from the differently spaced diffraction gratings compare

## Setting Up Your Experiment

Last week you did an exploratory measurement to determine the wavelength of your laser pointer. This week your goal is to collect more data to more accurately measure the wavelength. Before you start collecting data this week, think about sources of uncertainty in the exploratory measurements you did last week. What do you believe were the most significant sources of uncertainty. What can you do to reduce these sources of uncertainty this week? Are there sources of systematic error than can be randomized? 

When collecting data this week you will repeat the experiment with the two different spacings of diffraction grating that were provided and compare the results.

## Checkpoint 2

You should submit the following on Gradescope:

+ A plot used to determine the wavelength of your laser for the 500 lines/mm grating. This plot must include the uncertainties on your data points and include a line of best fit that has been determined with a weighted fit. As always make sure to include units on your axis labels.

+ A plot used to determine the wavelength of your laser for the 1000 lines/mm grating. This plot must include the uncertainties on your data points and include a line of best fit that has been determined with a weighted fit. As always make sure to include units on your axis labels.

+ A plot showing the wavelength you determined as a function of diffraction grating spacing for the two spacings of diffraction grating you measured. Your results should include your propogogated uncertainty in the wavelength as determined from your best fit line to the data you obtained for the position of interference maxima as a function of the separation of the diffraction grating from the screen.

+ Do your answers appear to agree with each other and with the wavelength specified by the manufacturer [630-680nm](https://laserclassroom.com/product/standard-red-laser-pointer/)? If not what do you think might explain the discrepancy?


These links are from a previous module and need to be updated:
+ [Submit the results of your single measurement on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/165932/assignments/605297){:target="_blank"}

+ And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-1){:target="_blank"}



When you're all finished and ready to move on, you can start [Week 2 - Hypothesis Testing Phase (part 1)](week2).
