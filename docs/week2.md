**We will make use of dry ice in lab this week. The only pre-lab reading for this week is to carefully review the [safety precautions at this link](dry-ice-safety).**

**The rest of the instructions in this week's lab manual do not need to be read in advance. The embedded mini-questions are intended to be completed in lab this week rather than in advance. You will only receive credit for the mini-questions if they are completed during the lab period. Instead of pre-lab reading we would like you to reflect on any discrepancies between your results from last week and the expected value and possible explanations for the discrepancy.**


## Experimental Iteration

We noticed that many of your results showed significant discrepancies between the measured speed of sound and the expected result. Please take a moment to reflect on those results. As a scientist, you must often track down the source of seemingly contradictory  results:

- Based on an informal estimate of uncertainty from wiggling parameters, can the sources of uncertainty you've looked at so far account for the discrepancy?

- Was the experiment flawed, or does the theory need to be modified?

By now you should have given serious consideration to possible sources of experimental error. Here are a few examples:

- does the height of the ruler matter?

- does the size of the beads make a difference?

- does the height of the camera make a difference?

- is uncertainty in the angular alignment of the camera to the acoustic resonator sufficient to account for any discrepancies?

- does it matter if the ruler is off to one side of the image rather than centering the image between the ruler and the camera?

Many of the above concerns arise from potential issues with parallax in the measurement. Why for example might we be concerned with the height of the ruler: Each millimeter mark on the ruler that is closer to the camera spans more pixels than the equivalent markings on the ruler further from the camera (if you didn't move the camera between images you can see this from your pixel-to-mm conversion without even taking the beads into consideration.) Ideally we would position the ruler at exactly the location of the beads and our problems would be solved. Unfortunately, the ruler would then interfere with the sound waves that are levitating the beads. The best thing we can do is position the ruler at the same distance from the beads as the camera, so that the ruler's magnification in the image is identical to the beads'. Try to find a good way to position the ruler in the same plane as the beads. However, this isn't the full story. If you have positioned your camera so that it is centered on the beads with the ruler off to one side, the distance from the camera to the ruler will not exactly match the distance from the camera to the beads. Try repositioning your acoustic levitator so the camera is centered between the beads and ruler.


Please take ~30 min to explore any sources of systematic error you may have overlooked. We are not looking for a careful systematic study of any of the above, just a quick assesment of whether or not any of these corrections are significant to explain any discrepancy between your measured speed of sound and the expected value. You may find this [website from the National Weather Service helpful for determining the expected speed of sound](https://www.weather.gov/epz/wxcalc_speedofsound). If you aren't sure what to estimate for the temperature in the lab your instructors can point you to a thermostat. 

When doing experiments this week please set up the experiment *using only your notes from last week* (not the lab manual). If you need to refer back to the lab manual, it is a sign that your notes are insufficiently comprehensive. *Take the time to prepare more detailed notes.*

Once you are confident that you have made a reasonable effort to explore the likely sources of systematic error in this experiment, please proceed to the following mini-question. You should not spend more than ~30 min before proceeding in order to ensure you have time to complete this week's experiments.

## Why Am I Getting Too Large a Value for the Speed of Sound?

You have surveyed a range of potential systematic errors and hopefully determined which ones appeared to be the most significant. After such a careful investigation it must have been satisfying to get a result that agreed to the expected value to within experimental error...... unless of course you didn't. 

Throughout this course we have we have asked you to pay careful attention to uncertainties. Here are some sample results reported by students last semester:

| Speed of Sound          | Uncertainty  | 
| ----------------------- | ------------ | 
| 360.5 m/s               | 1.2 m/s      | 
| 369.1 m/s               | 1.1 m/s      |
| 359.1 m/s               | 1.7 m/s      |

If you have appropriately controlled for systematic errors and accounted for random errors, your results should differ from the mean by approximately their uncertainty. But perhaps you still feel the above results are "close enough" to the expected value (343 m/s at $$20^{o}$$C). 

The above results differ from the expected value for the speed of sound by on the order 10x their uncertainty! To get a sense of how unlikely that is, for a normal distribution a $$5 \sigma$$ event, (i.e. 5 standard deviations from the mean) has a probability of 1 in $$\approx$$3.5 million, a $$6 \sigma$$ event has a probability of 1 in $$\approx$$0.5 billion. Clearly we should give some more thought to explaining the discrepancy between these results and the expected value.

When experimental results don't agree with the expected value it is a good idea to:
1. Check to make sure you trust your experimental results. Were you careful to minimize potential sources of systematic error and to appropriately randomize potential sources of uncertainty by resetting the experiment?
2. Check to make sure you trust the "expected value". For example, 343 m/s is the accepted value of the speed of sound under a specific set of conditions. Do those match the conditions in the lab? 343 m/s is the appropriate speed at $$20^{o}$$C. While the speed of sound depends on temperature, our laboratory conditions were close enough to $$20^{\circ}$$ C that we aren't going to be able to explain the discrepancy with temperature. You might also consider pressure, but the dependence of the speed of sound on pressure is extremely weak.
3. When all else fails it can be a good idea to check if you are confident in your theory. 

The theory we have relied upon assumes the levitator produces plane waves. Wouldn't it be nice if we could "see" the sound waves to assess if this is a reasonable assumption?  It turns out we can!

This week you will make use of dry ice to get a more 3-dimensional view of the standing wave pattern. You will not be asked to report on this in the checkpoint but it is interesting to see. 

This video gives you a sense of what to expect:

Before making use of dry ice make sure you reviewed the [safety precautions at this link](dry-ice-safety) - this is the same documentation that was provided for pre-lab reading.

**Please note the request within the safety documentation to bring your own safety glasses if you have them. If not safety glasses will be provided.**


Study the pattern of the sound waves with the dry ice - you should see significant deviations from plane wave behavior. We can in fact account for this! You will not be responsible for the details of the more complete theory but are encouraged to [read a summary here](gouy).

Bottom line:

You can correct for the 3D structure of the standing waves by applying the following correction to get the actual wavelength ($$\lambda$$) from  your measured value, $$\lambda_{\rm eff}$$:

\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}}{1+\frac{1}{\pi n}}
\end{equation}

For our system the instructors have determined that $$n=4.5 \pm 0.25$$. ([see previously mentioned supplemental materials](gouy)). 

Please make use of this correction to estimate the speed of sound. Do you get a more reasonable result?

Now that you are hopefully in range of the expected value it is a good moment to perform a more systematic study of one of the most significant sources of systematic error. Your earlier investigation should have guided you to at least one source of systematic error that has a significant effect on the results. Choose one and perform a systematic study analogous to the study that you used to produce figure 1 for your module 2 deliverable. We are interested in the possible effect on your results if you are not sufficiently careful with this parameter. Therefore we would like you to 
Before leaving the lab, make sure you record in your notebook which levitator you were using (they are numbered). That way when you return next week you can ensure you are using the same levitator which will be essential if you end up reusing any of the data you collected this week.

**Since we are focused entirely on parallax as a source of systematic error this week, when resetting the experiment it is only necessary to reset those parameters relevant to the source of parallax. You do not need to reset the beads themselves.**

## Further Exploration
If you have time you can use dry ice to get a more 3-dimensional view of the standing wave pattern. You will not be asked to report on this in the checkpoint but it is interesting to see.

## Checkpoint Instructions

For this week's checkpoint you will be asked to submit the following:

+ A description of what you did to minimize parallax as a source of systematic error with images showing your experimental setup. You will need to show both a top-view and side-view image to showcase your efforts to minimize parallax in both directions.

+ Your estimate for the wavelength of the sound wave in your experiment from 5 or more distinct measurements in which you attempted to randomize parallax as a source of uncertainty and subsequent estimate for the speed of sound, with uncertainty.

+ And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this weekâ€™s mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-2){:target="_blank"}
