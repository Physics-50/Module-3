# Week 4 - Science Communication 


## A Scientific Poster

What is poster?



Audience is important consideration.

If you are at a physical poster presentation, perhaps you would want to check out these [interesting ideas for creating a better poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs){:target="_blank"}.


But for Ph50, our audience is going to read our posters (we aren't going to present). There needs to be enough text to explain the poster.


What sections does a poster typically contain?

Methods section -- very abbreviated summary.


Poster needs to be a self-contained explanation of the work. Include all equations you refer to in your figure captions / main text.


### Tips
Make sure your main point pops out

Use font sizes that are large enough (24-28 pt font in our template for body text; >36 pt for headers)



Download the [Ph 50 Poster Template](Ph50-Poster-Template.pptx).



### How your poster will be evaluted

The final deliverable will be evaluated on the quality/clarity of the individual figures with captions, the cohesion and global coherence of the sequence of figures and text of the poster, how well the results were supported by the evidence provided, the accuracy and significance of the main result, and the accuracy and significance of any secondary results.
