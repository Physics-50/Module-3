## Further Explorations of an LCD: Liquid Crystals and Light Polarization

In this exploration you will continue to investigate the phenomenon of light polarization as well as the physics of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). 


## Display your computer screen on the LCD

This section will involve playing around with the LCD panel. Your first goal is to display an image on the panel by connecting your computer to the LCD and using a polarizer to modulate the intensity of a light source. Each station should have an LCD panel in an acrylic case that is fastened to an optical post and mounted on the optical rail.

 The HDMI cable that you will use to connect your computer as well as the power cable are attached. Please do not attempt to unplug either of these cables from the acrylic box.

For now we will use a desk lamp as the light source that will pass through the LCD. Remove the laser from the optical rail and take one of the desk lamps and angle the neck so that the light is above the optical rail, behind the LCD screen, and aimed so that it shines through the panel. In between the LCD screen and light, place a polarizer on the optical stand.

Why don't we need to install two polarizers like we did in the previous section? We actually are using two; it turns out there is a polarizer glued to the LCD (on the side that is closest to the case opening) so we only need to supply the polarizer for the other side!

Now turn on the desk lamp and plug the HDMI cable coming out of the LCD case into your computer. Look down along the optical rail, through both the LCD and the polarizer toward the lamp (never do this when using a laser!). Adjust the polarizer until there is a maximum amount of light from the lamp coming through the LCD.

Turn on the LCD screen by pressing the power button on the remote control. When the LCD is on you should see your computer screen on the LCD (or at the very least a screen saver for the LCD/projector if your computer is not properly mirroring its screen) when viewed as before, looking down the optical rail through the polarizer. If you are having trouble seeing your computer on the LCD there are a few things you can try: use a large sheet polarizer instead of the mounted one; try placing the polarizer on the other side of the LCD; check your screen mirroring settings on your computer to be sure it is outputting to the HDMI cable.

## LCD and polarization

The goal of the next portion of the experiment is to provide some intuition for how the pixels turn on and off.

Recall from the reading that an LCD panel is really a plate of 'liquid crystals' sandwiched between two polarizers. The effect of the liquid crystal array itself is to rotate the polarization of the light going through each pixel. If the polarization of light going through one liquid crystal is rotated such that the light is absorbed by the outer polarizer, then the intensity of light going out of that liquid is at a minimum. If, however, the polarization emerging from the liquid crystal is such that it aligns with the second polarizer, then the light passes through unscathed and the pixel 'lights up'. (See the <a href="http://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/index.php/module-3-week-2-prelab/">prelab</a> for additional details on this process.) Thus, the polarization rotation in each pixel in the the liquid crystal modulates that pixel's light intensity, allowing one to control which pixels light up and by how much.

Keeping the polarizer in the same orientation where the light throughput was maximized in the previous sub-section, open the image file <a href="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/white-background.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"white-background.png" (a plain white background) in a new tab and display it full screen (it should just be all white on your computer, turning all pixels "on"). What do you see? Is it bright or dark through the "white" screen? What do you think the LCD does to the polarization of light when we turn it on? Is the default setting to let all the light through or to block it?

Adjust the polarizer while you observe the LCD panel, which is still mirroring your computer display. Take notes on the effect of polarizer rotation on the LCD screen output. Feel free to play around a bit more, but don't spend too much time on this step as the lab is just getting started!

Adjust the polarizer so the brightness is now minimized through the white image file and note the angle on the polarizer. Open the image file <a href="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/black-background.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"black-background.png"</a>, which is all black and should, in effect, turn all of the pixels over the area of the image "off." Looking at your LCD, as before, does this new image file appear dark as it does on your computer screen? You are likely seeing a negative of your screen, meaning the intensities are reversed and dark objects are displayed as bright. Rotate your polarizer to make this image as dark as possible. How much did you need to rotate the polarizer? Is this what you expected?

Lesson check: what do you think the liquid crystal does to the polarization of light when it goes through a grey (i.e. not fully bright) pixel on the LCD? If you are curious, and have extra time, you can explore with this <a href="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grey-background.png">grey image file</a>.
