## Wiggling the parameters to explore sources of uncertainty

Next week we will perform a detailed investigation of a significant source of uncertainty. But first we need to do an exploratory study to determine which sources of uncertainty might be the most significant. This week we would like you to investigate 3 possible sources of systematic error. In your checkpoint you will be asked to report the following for each of the 3 sources of systematic error you investigated:

1) A single screenshot from your Google docs lab notebook that shows one or two images relevant to understanding what you did as well as relevant tabulated data. There is a template on the second page of the Google docs lab notebook that you may find helpful. 

2) A 2-4 sentence description of your investigation and your conclusion as to whether this was a significant source of uncertainty.

If you are having trouble working out what to investigate, please speak to your instructor. 


Please investigate at least 3 of the following:

### Presence of beads in the levitator

Are you concerned that the presence of the beads themselves might affect the speed of sound within the levitator? To investigate this try at least one of the following:

+ levitate as many beads as you can comfortably trap (in a reasonable time period). Take a picture. Now knock out all but the outermost beads (carefully). Take another picture. Compute the speed of sound in each case. Repeat this two more times. This is not enough data for statistical analysis but it can be enough to get a first impression as to whether there is a substantial effect

+ Some of the beads are of different sizes. Compare the results you get with small beads with those with larger beads. For now since we are just wiggling parameters rather than doing a systematic study, focus on the smallest beads available and the largest you can comfortably levitate (some may be too heavy). Again try this 3 times for each size of beads. 

## Parallax

Are you concerned that if the ruler is not at the same distance from the camera as the beads your results might be affected by **parallax**, which is *the effect in which the position or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions*? To investigate this try at least one of the following:

+ try positioning your ruler 1cm above the beads and then 1cm below the beads. Repeat to get three photos with the ruler in each position (you can leave the beads in place and just move the ruler for this test). 

+ you might also want to consider parallax in the horizontal direction. Try positioning your camera centered between the beads and the ruler. Now try centering the camera over the beads. Repeat for 3 pictures in each position. Again you do not need to reset the beads between these tests, just the camera.

## Your ability to determine the bead position

Are you concerned by how accurately you can determine the center of the beads? Try doing so in several ways. 

  + Can you guess where the center of the beads are and estimate the center that way?

  + What if you measure from the left edge of the leftmost bead to the left edge of the rightmost bead? Now do the same with the right edges. Are there any potential issues with this method?

  + Can you use your left edge and right edge results to more accurately determine the center of the beads?

## Additional sources of uncertainty

Do you have ideas for additional parameters you might wiggle to understand potentially significant sources of uncertainty in this experiment? For this week's checkpoint you are asked to investigate 3 potential sources of uncertainty. At least 2 of those should come from the suggestions above, the third can also come from the suggestions above or can come from your own ideas.

## Photo for Estimating the Speed of Sound

Once you've finished exploring sources of uncertainty, take a moment to reflect on your initial measurement. Are you now aware of sources of systematic error that may have significantly affected the accuracy of the results? You do not need to collect a full data set to estimate the speed of sound with uncertainty, we will do that in future weeks. But please collect one photo in which you make an attempt to minimize any sources of systematic error you found to be significant. Since you are only taking a single photo you will not be able to estimate the uncertainty in your result. That is okay we'll have time to do that in the coming weeks.
