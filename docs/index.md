## Module 2 Overview 

### Learning Objectives

1. Perform a weighted fit to a data set and use it to draw conclusions

2. Minimize and account for several sources of error in an experiment, including taking both sources of resolution uncertainty and systematic error into account.

In module 3 we will use a ruler to measure the wavelength of light and test a theory.

## Weekly Plan

In this module you will use the spacing between diffraction maxima to measure the wavelength of a laser pointer (provided). We will continue to investigate sources of uncertainty and the process of comparing our results with expectations. 

Module 2 is four weeks long. Each week, except the last week, you will have a checkpoint due. These checkpoints will give us a chance to provide you feedback as your work towards the Module 2 deliverable: a series of 2 figures that effectively communicates your results and key details of how the data was collected and analyzed. 

1. [Week 1 - Exploratory Phase](week1)
    - Checkpoint: a two-panel figure that showcases your results from exploring a significant source of systematic error in the experiment.
2. [Week 2 - Data Collection](week2)
    - Checkpoint: A figure showcasing your results from a 500 lines/mm grating
3. [Week 3 - Further Data Collection](week3)
    - Checkpoint: A figure showcasing your results from a 1000 lines/mm grating.
   <!-- - Checkpoint: A figure that allows comparison of your results from the 500 lines/mm and 1000 lines/mm gratings.>

4. [Week 4 - Scientific Communication Phase](week4)
    - Deliverable: a sequence of figures communicating your results from the module.
