## Module 1 Overview 

### Learning Objectives

1. Use experimental data to determine a physical quantity and test a hypothesis

2. Minimize and account for several sources of error in an experiment

3. Appreciate that theories are approximations of the physical world and may require refinement

4. Communicate approach, reasoning and results through a scientific poster

In module 3 we will use a ruler to measure the wavelength of light and test a theory.

## Weekly Plan
In this module you will use the spacing between diffraction maxima to measure the wavelength of a laser pointer (provided).
