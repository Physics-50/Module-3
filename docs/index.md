## Module 3 Overview

In this module you will investigate the effect of lighting conditions on the current, voltage, and power output of a solar panel.  In Week 1 you will measure an I-V (current vs. voltage) curve to characterize a solar panel's performance, and explore how that curve changes when you alter the lighting conditions in some way.  All lab groups in your class will share exploratory observations at the end of Week 1, and based on those initial observations each lab group will design an investigation to carry out during Weeks 2 and 3.  The goal of your investigation will be to choose an aspect of lighting conditions that can be varied in a systematic way, and determine experimentally how the solar panel output depends on the quantity you vary.  You will not be comparing your results to a theoretical prediction in this model, though you are welcome to compare findings with lab groups whose investigations are similar to your own.

### Learning Objectives

1. Design a systematic investigation of a physical phenomenon, choosing an independent variable to vary and one or more dependent variables to measure.
 
2. Create and execute a measurement plan for accuracy and precision, based on exploratory observations.

3. Choose and employ appropriate data and uncertainty analysis tools based on the nature of your experimental data.

4. Record and communicate experimental results.
