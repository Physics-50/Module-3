## Introduction

Last week you made a preliminary estimate of the speed of sound.  This week we want to take a deeper dive into a primary source of uncertainty, in order to improve the accuracy of both the result and the estimated uncertainty.

Last week, we encouraged you "to give some thought to the best positioning of the ruler for accurate measurements." This week we are going to explore this issue further.

The first thing we would like you to do is set up the experiment *using only your notes from last week* (not the lab manual). If you need to refer back to the lab manual, it is a sign that your notes are insufficiently comprehensive. *Take the time to prepare more detailed notes.*

## Parallax

<!--Take a picture with the ruler positioned ~1 cm above the beads. Now take one with it ~1 cm below. Estimate the speed of sound from both pictures. Is the difference significant? Hint: as a loose rule of thumb, a difference can be considered significant if it is greater than, or comparable to, the uncertainty from other sources. How does the difference between these two values compare with your uncertainty from last week?-->

Last week you investigated several potential sources of systematic error, among those was the effect of repositioning the ruler relative to the camera and levitator. If you didn't already do this last week please do the following:

Take a picture with the ruler positioned ~1 cm closer to the camera than the beads. Now take one with it ~1 cm further from the camera than the beads. Estimate the speed of sound from both pictures. Is the difference significant? Hint: as a loose rule of thumb, a difference can be considered significant if it is greater than, or comparable to, the uncertainty from other sources.

The issue arises from **parallax**. Each millimeter mark on the ruler that is closer to the camera spans more pixels than the equivalent markings on the ruler further from the camera (if you didn't move the camera between images you can see this from your pixel-to-mm conversion without even taking the beads into consideration.) Ideally we would position the ruler at exactly the location of the beads and our problems would be solved. Unfortunately, the ruler would then interfere with the sound waves that are levitating the beads. The best thing we can do is position the ruler at the same distance from the beads as the camera, so that the ruler's magnification in the image is identical to the beads'. Try to find a good way to position the ruler in the same plane as the beads. However, this isn't the full story. If you have positioned your camera so that it is centered on the beads with the ruler off to one side, the distance from the camera to the ruler will not exactly match the distance from the camera to the beads. Try repositioning your acoustic levitator so the camera is centered between the beads and ruler.

Next we would like to estimate the magnitude of this source of uncertainty. Perhaps you feel you have already done this? The pictures you took earlier probably convinced you that this is a significant source of uncertainty but if you are careful you should be able to position the ruler with much better accuracy than the $$\pm1~\mathrm{cm}$$ used to deliberately exaggerate the effect above!

## Systematic Error

Tackling systematic error is a two-step process; first you should try to reduce the source of error as much as possible. In this case that means working out how to position the ruler as well as you can. Then, as a second step, randomize the remaining uncertainty---by positioning the ruler "as well as you can" multiple different times---to account for the error appropriately within your uncertainty from repeated trials. Once you feel you've done as much as you can to minimize this source of uncertainty, you will need to do multiple measurements (5 in this course) resetting the position of the ruler each time to randomize the effect of imperfect positioning. (Note that replacing the ruler 5 times on the same support item does not count as resetting the ruler!) You will need to find a way to position the ruler that does not depend on resting it on a single fixed item that appeared to be in the plane of the beads (but is unlikely to be exactly the right position). Since we care about both the vertical and horizontal distance you will also need to reset the position of either the camera or the acoustic levitator. For this week, you may choose whether to reset both at once each time or to explore the two effects separately; the latter will give additional information about the relative effect of the two sources of uncertainty (which can be very useful if you find one of the sources of uncertainty to be insignificant). If you take this approach you should combine the uncertainties from the two sources *in quadrature* when reporting the final estimated uncertainty. However, **we recommend that you investigate both effects simultaneously**, since for today's purposes we are interested in the overall effect, so resetting both will save you time.

Before leaving the lab, make sure you record in your notebook which levitator you were using (they are numbered). That way when you return next week you can ensure you are using the same levitator which will be essential if you end up reusing any of the data you collected this week.

**Since we are focused entirely on parallax as a source of systematic error this week, when resetting the experiment it is only necessary to reset those parameters relevant to the source of parallax. You do not need to reset the beads themselves.**

## Further Exploration
If you have time you can use dry ice to get a more 3-dimensional view of the standing wave pattern. You will not be asked to report on this in the checkpoint but it is interesting to see. 

This video gives you a sense of what to expect:

Before making use of dry ice it is important that you carefully review the [safety precautions at this link](dry-ice-safety).

**Please note the request within the safety documentation to bring your own safety glasses if you have them. If not safety glasses will be provided.**


## Checkpoint Instructions

For this week's checkpoint you will be asked to submit the following:

+ A description of what you did to minimize parallax as a source of systematic error with images showing your experimental setup. You will need to show both a top-view and side-view image to showcase your efforts to minimize parallax in both directions.

+ Your estimate for the wavelength of the sound wave in your experiment from 5 or more distinct measurements in which you attempted to randomize parallax as a source of uncertainty and subsequent estimate for the speed of sound, with uncertainty.

+ And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week’s mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-2){:target="_blank"}
