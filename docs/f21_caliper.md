Reading Vernier Calipers¹

In this lab one device we have at our disposal for measuring lengths is the vernier caliper. These devices look simple compared to their digital counterparts but don't let their lack of a digital display fool you! These can actually measure down to 0.05 mm, or 50 $$ \mu$$m!

These calipers consist of a pair of jaws. The top jaw is attached to a fixed scale and the other attached to a sliding (vernier) scale.

In the above figure you can see that the smallest measurement on the main scale is 1 mm. while the vernier scale can read to 0.05 mm. To measure distance between the sliding jaws, you read the main and vernier scales as follows:

Find the location on the main scale that lines up with the 0 mark of the vernier scale. In the figure this would be between 1.1 and 1.2 cm. We will record the lower bounds on the range and use the vernier scale to find the next digits.

Find the mark on the vernier scale that most closely aligns with any mark on the main scale. Here, the 6 and 7 on the vernier scale are very close, but 6.5 lines up best with one of the marks on the main scale. This value is the number of hundredths of centimeters (or tenths of millimeters). So, the second reading is 0.065 cm.

Add the two values together to get the total reading: 1.1 cm + 0.065 cm = 1.165 cm. Not bad for a device without batteries!
