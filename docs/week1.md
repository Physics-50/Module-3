In this module you will be studying a light interference effect called <strong>diffraction</strong>. This phenomenon will allow you to measure the wavelength of visible light ($$400\text{ nm} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 750\text{ nm}$$, where $$1\text{ nm} = 10^{-9}\text{ m}$$).

## Background Theory


Start by reading the [background theory for Module 3 here](background-theory){:target="_blank"}.


**Before moving on, make sure you have read through the background theory at the link above!**


## Module 3 Goal

In Module 3, we will use the relationship derived in the background theory to determine $$\lambda$$, the wavelength of the laser, by measuring $$x$$ and $$L$$ for the first diffraction maximum ($$n=1$$), and using the quoted value of $$d$$ for the provided diffraction grating:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sYoung} 
\frac{xd}{L} = n \lambda
\end{equation}

The variables $$x$$, $$L$$, and $$d$$ were defined in the previously mentioned [background theory](background-theory){:target="_blank"}; please make sure you understand this formula and the relevant variables before proceeding.

## Setting Up Your Experiment

We will begin by setting up the experiment. It is easier to see the diffraction pattern in the dark, so most of this module will be conducted with the room lights off. You will find a lamp at your bench that you can use to illuminate your workspace as needed. Though everyone will probably want the lights on when first setting up the apparatus, anyone who is ready to start taking data can turn off the room lights after notifying the rest of the class. 

We will begin by setting up an optical rail. 


Attach the red laser to the laser holder mount, shown below in Figure 1, and attach it to a post holder placed on the optical rail with the laser facing the screen. (We don't want the laser light shooting across the room; please make sure when you set up your laser pointer that it is aimed at the wall, away from your classmates.) When adjusting the laser, the post, or the entire mount, be sure to loosen the relevant set screw and then re-tighten it by hand once you achieve the desired positioning.

**Figure 1** --- Laser holder, both with and without laser itself mounted. When adjusting a piece of the apparatus, be sure to loosen the relevant set screw before making adjustments, and then re-tighten it firmly afterwards.

**NEVER place your eye directly in the path of any laser beam.** Even if you are sure the laser is currently off, you should **never look directly down the beam path.**

Mount the grid paper "screen" to the vertical support at the end of your optical rail (in the direction the laser is pointing, i.e., near the wall).

Near the center of the rail, between the laser and the screen, attach another post holder, and use it to mount a diffraction grating, shown in Fig. 2.

**When handling the diffraction grating make sure to only touch the cardboard rim. Getting fingerprints on the transparent grating could affect your results.**

**Figure 2** ---  Diffraction grating. A diffraction grating is essentially just an array of slits placed right next to each other, with a very small slit distance <em>d</em> between each (on the order of one slit per micron). <!-- Each neighboring pair of slits can be thought of as a double slit. -->

<!-- A diffraction grating is essentially just an array of slits placed right next to each other, with a very small slit distance $$d$$ between each (on the order of one slit per micron). Each neighboring pair of slits can be thought of as a double slit. -->Based on the pre-lab reading (you might want to look back to Eq. 1) what do you think will happen to the location of the interference maxima (antinodes) when the spacing between slits becomes very small?

Slide the diffraction grating along the rail so it is very close to the screen; turn on the laser. You should see three or more dots on the screen. Slowly pull the grating away from the screen until the three dots take up most of the screen. Do not pull the grating back too far, as we want to be sure that the diffracted spots are hitting the screen and not flying across the room (we need to mitigate the risk of a laser beam striking an eye of a fellow lab-mate!).

You need not take any quantitative measurements yet; simply note qualitative observations. 

Make sure to **turn off your laser when inserting new components into the beam path**; it is hard to make sure that stray reflections don't momentarily hit someone in the eye while inserting pieces of glass or metal into a beam path.

Your diffraction gratings have been labelled with your station number (e.g. S01) and with a grating number (G01, G02, G03, G04, G05), with a label maker on the cardboard part of the diffraction gratings.  You have two such sets of diffraction gratings with different slit spacing. This week we will only be working with the 500 line/mm set of gratings. This spacing is marked on the gratings - make sure you are using the 500 line/mm gratings and put aside the 1000 line/mm gratings for now, you will not need them this week. Position diffraction grating "G01" between the laser and screen.


You will use a ruler to measure the distance $$x$$ between the central laser spot and the first interference maximum, as well as the distance $$L$$ of the diffraction grating from the screen. In planning your experiment think about how to do this as accurately as possible. What are the dominant sources of error? What can you do to minimize systematic error? Even when you've done your best to reduce systematic error, some will remain. What can you do to randomize the remaining systematic error?

In week one, we will attempt to answer these questions.

## Exploratory Measurements

As in previous modules, you should perform the following exploratory measurements and record them in your data sheet assigned from Google Classroom.

The ultimate goal of Module 3 is to determine the wavelength of your laser by measuring $$x$$ while varying $$L$$. However, for week 1, we will focus only on getting the most accurate measurement of $$x$$. To do so, we will "wiggle" our experimental parameters to find out which ones significantly change the value of $$x$$ that we measure. This is a typical first experimental step, and it will inform our experimental procedure that we will use next week.

Each time we measure $$x$$, we hope that we have set all the parameters perfectly (eg. the distance $$L$$ to the wall and the angle of the diffraction grating relative to the laser beam). However, it is impossible to set everything perfectly with zero uncertainty. If we are slightly off on any of the possible parameters, how much will that shift the value of $$x$$ that we measure?

Let's focus on the angle of the laser beam, which should ideally come in perpendicular to the diffraction grating. What range of angles away from perfectly perpendicular to the laser beam might the grating accidentally have? Perhaps we might not notice if we were off by angles up to $$\pm 5^{\circ}$$. How important is this? To answer this question, set up your experiment with <em>L</em> = 60 cm. To measure $$x$$, use your tape measure to determine the distance from the central bright spot to the next bright spot to the right. Take a minute or two right now, and go purposefully "wiggle" the grating so that its angle varies over this range, and take note of how much variation this causes in $$x$$.

In addition to the angle of the diffraction grating that you just explored, we have identified several other potential sources of uncertainty in $$x$$, listed below:

1. Distance from laser to diffraction grating (keeping the diffraction grating fixed in place, moving the laser). Range: $$\pm 0.5~\mathrm{cm}$$.
2. Vertical tilt of laser. Range: $$\pm 5^{\circ}$$.
3. The value of the diffraction spacing $$d$$ is also a parameter we can "wiggle," in a slightly less obvious way. Each diffraction grating could have manufacturing defects that cause $$d$$ to be slightly off from the stated value. We can see how this happens in two different ways:
+ There may be variation between diffraction gratings -- explore this by measuring $$x$$ for each of the 500 line/mm gratings. The gratings will be labelled with your station number (e.g. S01) and a grating number (e.g. G01).
+ There may be variation within a single diffraction grating -- explore this by measuring $$x$$ at five positions on one diffraction grating. 
4. The distance $$L$$ between the grating and the screen is something we will be systematically varying in Module 3, so that we can ultimately find the wavelength. But each time we set the value of $$L$$, we can only do so with some imprecision. Set $$L= 60~\mathrm{cm}$$, and then vary $$L$$ over a range of $$\pm 0.5~\mathrm{cm}$$.

For each of the five potential sources of uncertainty listed above (the angle of the diffraction grating, plus the four listed above), wiggle the parameter over the suggested range and record the variation in $$x$$. Since this is just an exploratory wiggling of parameters, you do not need to perform repeated trials of these tests. You only need to collect 3 data points - one at either end of the suggested range and one in the middle. It should take you about 15 minutes to wiggle all the parameters.

**The takeaway from this parameter-wiggling exercise is that the parameters that cause a larger variation in $$x$$ should be reset before each $$x$$ measurement. The ones that don't make much difference in $$x$$ do not need to be reset.**

#### Mini-question 3: Which parameters need to be reset?

**This mini-question cannot be answered until you are in lab. therefore for this question only, you should not answer the question before lab. You will only receive credit for this question if you answer it during your lab period.**

## Investigating systematic errors

In previous semesters, students measured the wavelength of their laser using a 500 line/mm diffraction grating. Here are a few example measurements, with uncertainty:

$$\lambda$$ (nm) | $$\delta \lambda$$ (nm) 
----------- | ----------------
658	|18
672|	7
683	| 4
694| 	7
719|	8

We are all using the same materials, so why don't our results agree?!?! Well, as you have just seen for yourself, the value of $$x$$ (and therefore ultimately the calculated wavelength) can be shifted in a systematic manner if important parameters are not reset before each trial. [Recall](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-2/week3){:target="_blank"} that resetting these parameters randomizes their impact on $$x$$, which averages out the shift.

Because systematic errors are so important in experimental research, we want you to do a careful study of one dominant source of systematic error in $$x$$. This study will ultimately be presented as part of a sequence of figures for your Module 3 deliverable.

Choose one source of uncertainty that you found to be significant, and carefully explore its effect on the measured value of $$x$$. **Do not choose to study $$L$$, since we will be studying that effect next week.** Think about how best to do this by carefully varying the chosen parameter (e.g., the angle of the diffraction grating, or the choice of diffraction grating). **You should have about five (no fewer) different values of the parameter you wiggle (e.g., angle of diffraction grating), and for each value of that parameter, you need to make five measurements of $$x$$** and report the average value of $$x \pm \text{SEM}$$ (as an error bar on each data point).

When setting up your experiment, **make sure the range over which you vary the parameter is relevant to the experiment**. For example, if you are varying the angle of the diffraction grating, you will gain more useful information by focusing on the effect at small angles ($$\lesssim 5^{\circ}$$).

As you set up to perform careful measurements, you may find it difficult to locate the maxima as precisely as you would like. You will collect additional measurements of these maxima in the coming weeks so it is worth investing the effort to determine a method that will allow you to perform the measurement precisely. Reducing the intensity of your diffraction maxima will reduce their spot size and may help with performing more precise measurements. One way to reduce the intensity of light is with two polarizers. [Click here for more information about polarizers](polarizers). Net effect of a polarizer: Only light polarized along the polarizer's axis will be transmitted. By adding a second polarizer and rotating the axis of its polarization you can control how much light gets through the pair! **Remember to turn off the laser when inserting components into the beam path of your laser.** Speak to your instructor if you would like to reduce the intensity of your beam but aren't sure how to make use of the polarizers.

 **Remember to reset all the other parameters that also have significant effects on $$x$$, for each measurement.** For example, if you are carefully studying the effect of choice of diffraction grating, make sure to reset both the angle of the diffraction grating and the distance $$L$$ between each of the five trials for each grating.  

This investigation will be part of your final deliverable, which will be evaluated partially based on the strength of the conclusions that you are able to support with evidence from your data. Make sure you select a significant source of systematic error as indicated by your preliminary experiment in which you "wiggled parameters."

For Checkpoint 1, you will present the results of this exploration as part of a figure with two panels:

+ Panel (a), containing a photo of your experimental setup, with $$x$$, $$L$$, and the parameter you varied clearly labeled. Depending on the parameter you varied you may find it works well to showcase this with a single photo or with two photos, one focused on the experimental setup and one on the parameter you varied. Either choice is acceptable.
+ Panel (b), a plot with $$x$$ on the vertical axis and the parameter you varied on the horizontal axis. Be sure to plot your data points with error bars, following our [figure-making guide from Module 1](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/week4){:target="_blank"}. It is not necessary to perform a fit to your $$x$$ data. 

To reduce workload for this week, you do not need to write a caption for the figure.

-------------

## Checkpoint 1

You should submit the following on Gradescope:

+ The two-panel figure described above. Note that you do not need to submit a caption, just the figure with the two panels.

+ A link to a spreadsheet with your experimental data. Reminder: all calculations, including your calculation of the speed of sound and appropriate uncertainties, should be included (in the form of evaluated formulas) in your spreadsheet.

+ Conclusions regarding the significance of your investigated source of experimental uncertainty. Remember, as a rule of thumb, if the parameter we varied were **not** significant we would expect the data points to be about one error bar away from the mean on average. Does your data show significantly greater variation than this?
