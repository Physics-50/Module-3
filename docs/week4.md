3. [Deliverable - Sequence of Figures](#deliverable)

--------------

Although you are not required to attend lab this week, we **strongly** recommend that you do so --- attending the lab work session is a great opportunity to get direct feedback as you work on your deliverable. If issues were raised with any of your checkpoints you can also use this time to collect additional data as needed.

This week we will take another look at your analysis leading to the estimated wavelength of your laser and provide advice for communicating your results through a sequence of figures.

## Experimental Iteration

We noticed that many of your results showed significant discrepancies between the results measured with the two gratings and between the values you reported and the manufacturer's specifications (written on the laser). Please take a moment to reflect on those results. As a scientist, you must often track down the source of seemingly contradictory  results:

- Was the experiment flawed, or does the theory need to be modified?

- Did your results from the two differently spaced diffraction gratings agree?

- Did they agree with the wavelength specified by the manufacturer?

By now you should have given serious consideration to possible sources of experimental error. Here are a few examples:

1. We provided five diffraction gratings for each grating period. In week 1 did you look at the $$x$$ values for several gratings? Did you either find the difference to be negligible, or randomize across gratings in weeks 2 and 3?

2. Were you careful to ensure the beam path was perpendicular to the screen? It can be helpful to compare the distance to the first maxima on the left and right as part of this consideration.

3. Were you careful to ensure the beam path was horizontal?

4. Did you collect data over a wide range of $$L$$ values?

5. What other potential sources of error can you think of?

*Most students should not need to collect any new data this week. If no concerns were raised with your checkpoint and you feel you already made an effort to control these potential sources of systematic error you can proceed straight to the miniquestion.* However, if issues were raised with your checkpoints we encourage you to check in with us in office hours and/or talk to us during the week 4 lab period.

If there is a significant discrepancy between your results and expectations (and particularly if your reported wavelength is not <span style="color: #FF0000;">red</span> something has gone wrong). We would like you to put some serious effort into working out what went wrong and if possible, correcting your results. This is expected for the deliverable.

## Week 4 Tasks

You have two tasks this week:

1. If your results differ from expectations or are inconsistent, seek to determine why.

2. Once you are confident in your results you should regenerate the plot of wavelength vs. grating period from last week and fit a horizontal line as we did in Module 2 to generate your best estimate of the laser wavelength and its uncertainty from the plot.

3. Your third task is to prepare a sequence of 2 figures with captions to submit for your deliverable. These figures will come directly from the work you have done in the preceding 3 weeks.



## <a name="deliverable">Deliverable --- A Sequence of Two Figures

Your Module 3 deliverable will consist of two figures. Each of these figures must include a caption following the guidelines provided for Modules 1 and 2. We encourage you to refer back to the [figure preparation guide from Module 1](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/week3){:target="_blank"} and feedback you received on your module 2 deliverable, including the information provided [here](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-2/deliverable). 

Before preparing a figure caption you should take a moment to ask yourself: “What do I want to convey to my reader?” and to further break that down into smaller questions. It is important to us at this stage in the course that you learn to recognize what is important so we are not going to provide an exhaustive list, but here are two questions to get you started:

+ What was my primary result from the experiment?
+ What would a fellow student who hasn’t taken this course need to know in order to look at my data and understand key details of how it was collected

This list is just the beginning of a list, can you think of more questions that might help you to focus on what might be important to convey to your reader? We would be happy to discuss your list of questions with you (in lab in week 4 or in office hours) before you begin writing your caption. After you’ve written the caption it is a good idea to look back to your list of questions and make sure you answered them.


Note that if the perspective of the picture of your experimental setup makes it difficult to accurately define a reasonable scale bar, you can use something in the picture to provide a length scale. For example, if the caption indicates the length of the laser or the spacing of the grid marks, this would be sufficient to convey the length scale to the reader. 

The following should be submitted on Gradescope:

+ **Figure 1** is equivalent to the figure you submitted for week 1, but with a caption that reports the salient details of the procedure you used. If any issues were raised with your week 1 checkpoint or even if they weren't but you feel you could present your results better (we do not use the same rubric for the checkpoints and deliverable) we encourage you to speak to us and make appropriate corrections before submitting your deliverable. 

+ **Figure 2** will also be a multi-panel figure. 
    - **Panel (a)** will showcase how you determined the wavelength. Namely, panel (a):  **Provide a single example plot of $$x$$ vs. $$L$$ for one of the diffraction grating spacings** 
    - **Panel (b)** will plot of wavelength vs. grating period. This plot should be prepared after resolving any issues with your initial results. Your plot should include a horizontal line fit to the two data points as well as dashed horizontal lines indicating the uncertainty of the fit. You will need to add these to the MATLAB script. Your caption should include your primary result (estimated wavelength quoted with uncertainty using appropriate significant figures).
    
    
In all cases make sure your figure captions include sufficient details to stand alone (while respecting the concision expected for a caption). **Note the number of trials that contributed to each data point.** Since resetting parameters such as the position/angle of the diffraction grating, $$L$$, or which diffraction grating was used, were an important part of the experimental procedure for this experiment, you should mention this procedure in the caption.**An HMC sophomore who has not taken Physics 50 should be able to look at your figure with caption and have a clear idea of what you did.**

+ You will be asked to upload some additional information for grading quality of data including some of your results and a link to your **well-organized** spreadsheet

*Please note that you will need to upload each figure three times. You need to include both the figure and caption each time.*
