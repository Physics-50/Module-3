## Week 4: Preparation of your Deliverable

1. [Deliverable](#deliverable)

There are no experiments this week but you are required to attend lab to work on your deliverable.

## Deliverable

Your deliverable will consist of two multi-panel figures with  captions. Each figure should have a single caption that describes all panels. You should make use of the instructions for the module 1 and 2 deliverables as a guide.

Like for module 2, figure 1 will focus on your inves
Figure 1 must include:

+ one or more images showing how you collected your data
    - Please mark the origin you used for data collection on your image and also annotate the image (neatly) to show the horizontal (or vertical) distance as measured to a sample bead. Label this distance with a parameter, e.g. "$$d$$" and define the parameter in your caption.

+ a plot of bead position vs. node number with uncertainties on each data point and a linear regression fit weighted by the uncertainties. This plot must be prepared in MATLAB.

+ a caption that follows the guidelines outlined in Module 1, week 3. Make sure to include your main result (the measured speed of sound with uncertainty) in your caption. Relevant fit parameters such as the $$\chi_\nu^2$$ value for the fit should be included in the caption, not shown on the plot (and defined where appropriate).

Additional note on figure captions: In this course your figure caption needs to stand alone and present your results. Your statement regarding your conclusions should include relevant supporting information. For example you might use your $$\chi_{\nu}^2$$ value to support your confidence in the result, or if you have identified a systematic error that might explain deviations from the expected value (and have checked that the correction would shift the result in an appropriate direction) you should include relevant information in your caption. But remember it is a caption, so keep all details concise. Information on how to interpret your $$\chi_\nu^2$$ value can be found in the [curve fitting guide from week 3](curve-fitting){:target="_blank"}.

+ You will also be asked to provide a link to your organized spreadsheet. This spreadsheet must include the calculations you did as part of your data analysis, entered as formulas in the Google spreadsheet.

+ And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this weekâ€™s mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-4){:target="_blank"}.
