# Module 3 Week 2 Pre-lab


There is no pre-lab for Week 2.

However, take a moment to think ahead to the Technical Report, which will take up the remaining lab weeks after Module 3 Week 3.  For the tech report you will come up with a question and investigate it using equipment based one of the three modules you have already done (or begun) in this course.  Your instructor will provide you with more information and can help you with some ideas if you would like.  You may work with up to two partners, but they must be in your lab section so that you can work together effectively.  As your Module 3 Week 3 mini-question, you will be asked to submit a tech report idea and a list of equipment you need for your experiment.  You might want to start thinking about it now!
