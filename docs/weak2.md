This week we will continue our investigation of the wavelength the light from the laser pointer you were shipped. 

## Setting Up Your Experiment

Last week you did an exploratory measurement to determine the wavelength of your laser pointer. This week your goal is to collect more data to more accurately measure the wavelength. Before you start collecting data this week, think about sources of uncertainty in the exploratory measurements you did last week. What do you believe were the most significant sources of uncertainty. What can you do to reduce these sources of uncertainty this week? Are there sources of systematic error than can be randomized?

The kit you received includes diffraction gratings with two different spacings.

#### Miniquestion: How do the diffraction patterns from the differently spaced diffraction gratings compare

------------------------------


When collecting data this week we would like you to take into consideration the sources of uncertainty just discussed and do your best to minimize uncertainty and randomize systemtic error. 

We expect you to collect data this week with the two different spacings of diffraction grating that were provided and compare the results.

We would also like you to choose one source of uncertainty that you believe to be significant and systematically explore its significance. Think about how best to do this. Ultimately you will find it helpful if you are able to get results which you can present as a figure in your final deliverable.

## Checkpoint 2

You should submit the following on Gradescope:

+ Results from your exploration of one source of uncertainty. We suggest presenting these results as a figure. Most of the time this is the best way to present scientific data.

+ A plot used to determine the wavelength of your laser for the 500 lines/mm grating. This plot must include the uncertainties on your data points and include a line of best fit that has been determined with a weighted fit. As always make sure to include units on your axis labels.

+ A plot used to determine the wavelength of your laser for the 1000 lines/mm grating. This plot must include the uncertainties on your data points and include a line of best fit that has been determined with a weighted fit. As always make sure to include units on your axis labels.

+ A plot showing the wavelength you determined as a function of diffraction grating spacing for the two spacings of diffraction grating you measured. Your results should include your propogogated uncertainty in the wavelength as determined from your best fit line to the data you obtained for the position of interference maxima as a function of the separation of the diffraction grating from the screen.

+ A link to a spreadsheet with your experimental data

+ Do your measurements of the wavelength using two different diffraction gratings agree with each other and with the wavelength specified by the manufacturer [630-680nm](https://laserclassroom.com/product/standard-red-laser-pointer/)? If not what do you think might explain the discrepancy?


These links are from a previous module and need to be updated:
+ [Submit the results of your single measurement on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/165932/assignments/605297){:target="_blank"}

+ And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-2){:target="_blank"}



When you're all finished and ready to move on, you can start [Week 3 - Hypothesis Testing Phase (part 2)](week2).
